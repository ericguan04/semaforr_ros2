High level functions:
* `pipeline.py`: combines all the functions from `utils.py` and `wrapper.py` into one end-to-end function for trajetory prediction
* `utils.py`: contains functions for preprocessing the raw data, predicting, and processing the output data 
* `wrapper.py`: contains preprocessing functions used by the deep learning model

See `test.py` and `example_run.ipynb` for examples of these functions being used
